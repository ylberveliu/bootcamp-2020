    <h1>Salted Chocolate Cookies</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Made with two types of cocoa powder for deep chocolate flavor, these dark chocolate cookies feature soft, 
            brownie-like centers and crisp edges. They’re studded with chocolate chips and sprinkled with sea salt for a little something special!

        <h2>How to prepare</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour is the base of these cookies. We don’t use as much as in non-chocolate cookie recipes because the cocoa powder also provides structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Cocoa Powder:</strong> For intense dark chocolate flavor, use 2 types of cocoa powders– natural cocoa powder and Hershey’s special dark cocoa powder. Have you ever used Hershey’s special dark cocoa powder before? It’s deep, dark, and bold. This is actually a cocoa powder that’s a blend of natural cocoa and dutched cocoa (and here is even more information about <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/baking-basics-dutch-process-natural-cocoa-powder/" rel="">Dutch-process vs. natural cocoa powder</a>). It really heightens the chocolate flavor in these cookies!</li>
            <li><strong>Baking Soda:</strong> Baking soda helps the cookies rise.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt &amp; Vanilla Extract:</strong> Both add flavor. Try using <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-vanilla-extract/" rel="">homemade vanilla extract</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Butter adds delicious flavor and texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> We use a combination of granulated sugar and brown sugar for sweetness and softness.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg:</strong> 1 egg helps bind everything together.</li>
            <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Milk smooths out the cookie dough.</li>
            <li><strong>Chocolate Chips &amp; Chunks:</strong> Use a handful of chocolate chips and pure chocolate chopped into chunks– the pure chocolate chunks melt down since they do not contain any stabilizers (unlike chocolate chips) and create pools of chocolate inside and outside of the cookies (!!).</li>
            <li><strong>Sea Salt:</strong> While optional, I like to sprinkle each cookie dough ball with a little sea salt before baking. The sea salt offsets the sweetness and brings out even more chocolate flavor.</li>
        </ul>
